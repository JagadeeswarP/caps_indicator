Caps Lock Indicator ‚Äì Python Utility for Windows

## ‚ùì Problem
Many laptops do not provide a clear indication when Caps Lock is ON or OFF.  
This can lead to frustration ‚Äî especially when typing passwords or working in programming environments.

This tool solves that by providing a tiny, customizable pop‚Äëup whenever Caps Lock state changes.

## ‚ú® Features
- Displays a pop‚Äëup when Caps Lock is toggled (ON/OFF)
- Auto‚Äëhides after 2 seconds
- Runs silently in background using `pythonw`
- Can be set to run at startup
- Lightweight (no heavy dependencies)

1. Clone the repository or copy the code

2. Install dependencies :   pip install pywin32

3. Run the script : python caps_indicator.py

4. (Optional) Run silently in background : pythonw caps_indicator.py

Then, add that folder path to the Windows Environment Variables. (Select System Variables --> path --> select and create a new path then-->  paste the path  of caps_indicator.py )
